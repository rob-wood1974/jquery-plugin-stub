> Create a jQuery plugin stub/skeleton (using RequireJS with core dependencies and dev tasks setup) with [grunt-init][].

[grunt-init]: http://gruntjs.com/project-scaffolding

## Installation
If you haven't already done so, install [grunt-init][].

Once grunt-init is installed, place this template in your `~/.grunt-init/` directory. It's recommended that you use git to clone this template into that directory, as follows:

```
git clone https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-init-jquery-plugin-stub.git ~/.grunt-init/jquery-plugin-stub
```

```
_Windows users:
git clone https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-init-jquery-plugin-stub.git %userprofile%/.grunt-init/jquery-plugin-stub
```

## Usage

At the command-line, cd into an empty directory, run this command and follow the prompts.

```
grunt-init jquery-plugin-stub
```

_Note that this template will generate files in the current directory, so be sure to change to a new directory first if you don't want to overwrite existing files._
